# Drone Simulation
## Required Software
  In order to test the code, we will be using a virtual machine with Ubuntu installed. Our VM provider will be VirtualBox due to previous experience with the platform. As well as it being free. We will be using ROS2 for our project. After reviewing both ROS and ROS2, the later seems more orientated to our goal.
## Required Hardware
  No hardware was used for the simulation. Future work could include a Tello drones
