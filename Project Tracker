Project Tracker:
•	Come Up with idea (drone swarm with ros and gazebo)
•	Research drones and ros
•	Install virtual box 
•	Create VM with Ubuntu 20.04
•	Install Ros Noetic and Gazebo 11 (debate between ros 1 and ros 2)
•	Try to use drone model sjut_drone (failure wrong version of everything)
•	Retry sjut_drone with ubuntu 18.04 Ros Melodic and Gazebo 9’
•	Continue not working (model wont load catkin_make not making 
•	In research for solutions and drone knowledge find MATLAB/Simulink solution
•	Install MATLAB toolboxes (UAV, Aerospace and auxiliaries)
•	Open up parrot Drone model and start working through block diagram
•	Run different trajectories and different detections via camera sensors
•	Attempt adding in second drone (failure MATLAB not designed for this)
•	Found other options but for HW no time to get the pieces
•	Little HW (thanks Amazon) able to develop camera with face tracking
