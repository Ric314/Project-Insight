# Weekly Update
## Week 1, 03/21/2022: 
  Website(Github) created
## Week 2, 03/28/2022: 
  Researched into ROS/ROS2 <br>
  Looking into similar projects
## Week 3, 04/04/2022
  Resarch into ROS implementation with drones <br>
  Studied drone dynamics for control architecture
## Week 4, 04/11/2022
  Begin implementaion with ROS and virtual machine (VirtualBox) <br>
  Ubuntu (Noetic) with Gazebo v.11
## Week 5, 04/18/2022
  Switched to ROS2 for VM errors <br>
  Ubuntu (Melodic) with Gazebo v.9
## Week 6, 04/25/2022
  Virtual machine compile errors, unable to simulate drone in Gazebo <br>
  Due to time restraints, refocusing goal on implementaion of single autonomous drone <br>
  Looking into other platforms such as MATLAB and python <br>
  Branch project started - Face recognition and tracking
## Week 7, 05/02/2022
  After further research and coding, MATLAB has been chosen as platform <br>
  Successfully simulated drone in Simulink <br>
  Face tracking hardware recieved; code implemented on assembled structure succefully
## Week 8, 05/09/2022
  Finalizing documentation <br>
  MATLAB and FT code reviewed for optimization <br>
  Working on presentation <br>
## Future Work
  Simulate three drones in different platform <br>
  Alternatively program multiple drones through MATLAB and skip simulation <br>
  Face tracking SW/HW could be improved <br>
    Structure slightly unstable <br>
    Code could lock onto single face rather than detect smaller faces
